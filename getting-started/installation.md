  <h1>Installation</h1>

Getting started with a new web framework can be a bit scary. Luckily, Scalatra
is easy to install, as it has relatively few dependencies.

## 1. Install a JDK

Scalatra is web microframework written in Scala, so you'll need to have a
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Many systems will already include
a JDK (do `java -version` and `javac -version` in a terminal to find if yours
does).

<span class="badge badge-info"><i class="icon-flag icon-white"></i></span>
If you don't yet have Java installed, you can find out how to install
it for your system 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html">
over at the Java 7 install page</a>. Make sure you've got Open JDK or Sun JDK,
as <code>gcj</code>, which is pre-installed on some Linux distros, won't work.
</div>

Once you're sure you've got Java installed, you need to download a few other
utilities. 

[Conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript) is a tool for installing and
updating Scala code. [Giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8/), which depends
on conscript, allows you to check out project templates directly from Github.
It's the recommended way of getting started with Scalatra.

Then, you'll need SBT, the Simple Build Tool. This is a Scala program which will 
automatically download everything your Scalatra project needs, and build it.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="myTab">
  <li class="active"><a href="#stack">Install the TypeSafe Stack</a></li>
  <li><a href="#manual">Install Manually</a></li>
</ul>
 
<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="stack">
  	<p>TypeSafe is a Scala consulting company which maintains both the Scala language itself
  	and quite a few of its associated tools. They offer easy-to-install packages for
  	most systems: Windows, Mac OS X (via homebrew), Debian/Ubuntu, and Red Hat Linux.</p>

  	<p>The TypeSafe Stack includes everything you'll need to get started with Scalatra, including
  		sbt, conscript, and giter8.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="manual">

  	If you'd rather install things yourself, it's still a very easy process. 

  	<h4>Install SBT</h4>

  	The next thing you'll need is `sbt`, the Simple Build Tool. 

  	You can download `sbt` at the [SBT website](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

  	### 3. Install conscript and giterate

  	To install conscript, issue this command in your terminal:

  	{% highlight bash %}

  	  curl https://raw.github.com/n8han/conscript/master/setup.sh | sh

  	{% endhighlight %}

  	This will create a _bin_ folder in your home directory.  Put that on your
  	path, by adding the following to your shell's profile (e.g. ~/.bash_profile):

  	{% highlight bash %}

  	  PATH=$PATH:~/bin
  	  export path

  	{% endhighlight %}

  	Make sure you reload your shell:

  	{% highlight bash %}

  	  source ~/.bash_profile

  	{% endhighlight %}


  	Now you can use conscript to install Giter8:

  	{% highlight bash %}

  	  cs n8han/giter8

  	{% endhighlight %}

  	Depending on your connection speed, this can take a bit of time, as `conscript` 
  	downloads quite a few Scala dependencies.

<script>
  $(function () {
    $('#myTab a:last').tab('show');
  })
</script>

<span class="badge badge-info"><i class="icon-flag icon-white"></i></span>
That's it! You've now got everything you need.

Head over to the "[first steps](first-steps.html)" page, which will tell you how to generate,
build, and run a Scalatra application.
