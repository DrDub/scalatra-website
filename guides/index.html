<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>We've documented most aspects of working with Scalatra in a series of guides covering common development tasks.</p>


<div class="row">
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Routes &amp; actions</h3>
		<p>Scalatra is a MVC micro-framework.  The <emphasis>controller</emphasis> part is handled by a routing DSL based on Sinatra's, although you can also use Rails-style routing conventions if you want to. The <a href="routes-and-actions.html">routes &amp; actions</a> guide shows you how to tie HTTP url paths to code you want to run on the server.</p><p><a href="routes-and-actions.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Views</h3>
		<p>You can easily add templating capabilities to your application so that you can render templates, layouts, and partials. This guide provides an introduction to Scalatra's default templating system, Scalate.</p><p><a href="views.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Helpers</h3>
		<p>Scalatra includes several dozen helper integrations so that you can easily accomplish commond development tasks. This guide shows you how to select and add helper traits to your application, for things like Flash map integration, session handling, redirects, getting access to the request, and cross-origin resource sharing.</p><p><a href="helpers.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>
