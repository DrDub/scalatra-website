# Scalatra project

This is the home of The [Scalatra](http://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/)
website which generates the site at http://scalatra.org.

To build it, you'll need to have [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
installed on your system.  See the Jekyll docs for installation instructions.

Once Jekyll's installed, you can do this to generate the documentation:

 cd scalatra-website
 jekyll --server --auto

This will start an embedded webserver and automatically regenerate the website
as you make changes to it. You can then view the site at http://localhost:4000.
