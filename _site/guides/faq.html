<p>  dt Should I extend ScalatraServlet or ScalatraFilter?</p>

<p>  dd</p>

<pre><code>:markdown
  The main difference is the default behavior when a route is not found.
  A filter will delegate to the next filter or servlet in the chain (as
  configured by web.xml), whereas a ScalatraServlet will return a 404
  response.

  Another difference is that ScalatraFilter matches routes relative to
  the WAR's context path.  ScalatraServlet matches routes relative to
  the servlet path.  This allows you to mount multiple servlets under in
  different namespaces in the same WAR.

  ### Use ScalatraFilter if:
  - You are migrating a legacy application inside the same URL space
  - You want to serve static content from the WAR rather than a dedicated web server

  ### Use ScalatraServlet if:
  - You want to match routes with a prefix deeper than the context path.

  Why am I getting errors like `foo is not a member of package org.blah`?

  sbt does not update your dependencies before compilation.  Run `sbt update` and then retry your build.

<p>  dt How can I prevent OutOfMemoryErrors in sbt?
  dd</p>

<pre><code>:markdown
  Try changing your sbt shell script, as recommended by the [Lift Wiki](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Using_SBT):

      java -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx512M -Xss2M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
